        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "- Typically, $\\beta \\approx 0$ and is statistically insignificant; any exploitable serial correlation would be rapidly arbitraged away.  \n",
        "- Even when weak autocorrelation exists, the associated $R^2$ is small, implying limited economic value and high implementation risk for a pure index-timing rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Momentum as a Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "If the regression above revealed a small positive $\\beta$, one could translate that intuition to the cross-section by buying recent winners and shorting recent losers—harvesting persistence in relative performance rather than timing the aggregate index.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Diversifying across many stocks reduces idiosyncratic variance, improving the signal-to-noise ratio even when the edge per name is small.  \n",
        "- Emphasizing extremes (e.g., top vs. bottom quantiles of past returns) amplifies the signal while diversification helps contain volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key levers for Momentum Strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "If we have an edge, we can act differently and gain from momentum\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lever 1: Play on winners and losers, and not just one asset\n",
        "- Lever 2: Play on a number of winners and losers \n",
        "- Lever 3: Play with transaction costs. We can do this either by slowing down the ranking (12 months vs 1 month) or increaing the band of winners and losers."

        "## Case Study\n",
        "\n",
        "In early 2009, AQR considered launching three long‑only, open‑end retail mutual funds to deliver the equity momentum factor to a broad advisor/retail channel—the first retail funds explicitly dedicated to momentum. The strategy is the classic cross‑sectional winner‑minus‑loser effect: stocks that outperformed their peers over the prior 12 months (skipping the most recent month) continue to outperform, and vice versa. The case walks through the empirical evidence, the regulatory and product‑design constraints of retail mutual funds, AQR’s decision to build their own long‑only momentum indices, and the implementation choices (rebalance, trading, taxes, tracking error, and whether to co‑mix other signals).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What AQR is doing?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Product scope:** AQR planned three funds aligned to three new long‑only momentum indices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- US Large‑Cap (top 1,000 US stocks),\n",
        "- US Small‑Cap (next 2,000),\n",
        "- International Large‑Cap (~1,000 non‑US large caps).\n",
        "\n",
        "Constituents were reselected each quarter as the top one‑third of the universe by past t‑12 to t‑2 returns (skipping the last month), and cap‑weighted to avoid unintended small‑cap bets. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Distribution:** Unlike AQR’s hedge funds, the target channel here was financial advisors in the retail mutual fund market (open‑end funds with daily NAV and daily liquidity), not institutional LPs. \n",
        "\n",
        "Index first, fund second. Because mutual fund advisors cannot use backtests, AQR created and licensed momentum indices that could publish historical performance independently of fund marketing. The indices doubled as investor tools and as possible benchmarks for the eventual funds. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why not simply use UMD? \n",
        "\n",
        "UMD is long‑short, monthly‑rebalanced, and built from the full stock universe (including microcaps)—not replicable as a retail long‑only fund. Hence AQR created long‑only, large‑ and small‑cap indices with quarterly rebalances and liquidity screens.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The five big implementation choices:\n",
        "- Rebalance frequency (quarterly vs. more often).\n",
        "- Boundary (edge) trading.\n",
        "- Execution speed (fast vs. slow).\n",
        "- Taxes (very real for retail).\n",
        "- Should other signals influence buys/sells? (Ex: Short term reversal?)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The hardest empirical nuance: momentum crash risk\n",
        "\n",
        "Momentum’s long‑run mean is high, but its left tail can be vicious—notably during sharp market rebounds after deep selloffs when past losers rip higher and past winners lag.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Trading costs & capacity—will alpha survive implementation?\n",
        "\n",
        "AQR’s design choices directly address this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cap‑weighting within the top third avoids oversized micro‑cap exposure.\n",
        "- Quarterly rebalance + banding reduces unnecessary turnover.\n",
        "- Large internal flow potential enables crossing and schedule control.\n",
        "\n",
        "All three raise the odds that net‑of‑cost alpha remains positive in a mutual‑fund wrapper."

Momentum had been common in hedge funds and institutional mandates, but not in open‑end mutual funds available via the financial‑adviser channel. To enable retail access, AQR designed long‑only, cap‑weighted momentum indices (large‑cap US, small‑cap US, large‑cap international) rebalanced quarterly, with S&P as calculation agent. This differs from the academic UMD long‑short factor and from monthly all‑stock rebalancing. It also focuses on liquid names to serve daily flows. Mutual Funds also tend to be open-ended - be ready to return capital at the end of the trading day to respond to investor redemptions if any."

        "<font color=\"red\"> Long‑only momentum typically shows high market correlation (≈0.9) because we keep the “UP” leg without shorting “DOWN”. Long‑short UMD remains low/negative corr to MKT and negative to HML, delivering diversification even when mean returns are low. This is exactly why AQR framed momentum as a complementary style to value. In retail mutual funds, long‑only is the feasible packaging, but its portfolio role is different. It is more return‑seeking, less diversifying."
